# My Personal Project

## Phase 0

**What will my project do:**

My project will be a banking interface that allows users to store money in multiple accounts, 
transfer money between account, "Deposit" and "withdraw" money (for demonstration purposes only),
and allow users to buy banking products and assets from the bank. 

**Who will use it:**

My application will be used by clients of a bank.

**Why is this of interest to me:**

I'm interested in all the security measures and regulations around digital banking,
and this seems like a good way to explore all the details of banking systems that the client
usually never gets to see. 

## User Stories:

- I want to be able to create a person at a bank, and add accounts under that person
- I want to be able to view how much each account is worth at any given time
- I want to be able to transfer money between accounts 
- I want to be able to deposit and withdraw money from any account

### Phase 2 user stories:

- As a client of the bank, I want to be able to save the status of my finances when I leave the application (If I choose)
- As a client of the bank, I want to be able to load a saved version of my accounts and assets at the bank (If I choose)
